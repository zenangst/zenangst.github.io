                <p>
                Hi there! I'm Christoffer Winterkvist, a Swedish person who somehow ended up in Oslo, Norway. By day, I'm an iOS developer, but by night, I transform into a mad scientist creating macOS applications.
                </p>

                        One of my most legendary creations is Keyboard Cowboy, a wild and untamed beast of a keyboard shortcut application. It's free, it's open-source, and it's ready to wrangle your shortcuts like a wild stallion.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Giddy up!
